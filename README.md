## Source

The logic and idea, as well as part of the code of this application, come from Sven Bosau. The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/Sven-Bo/streamlit-sales-dashboard). It was recreated using Taipy.

## What is demo Sales Dashboard

Taipy is a  low-code Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our [website](https://www.taipy.io).

[Demo Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/Avaiga/demo-sales-dashboard) demonstrates how Taipy can read an Excel file and show interesting results. This will the base of our DataViz application. The user can filter it based on city, customer, and gender. This allows users to see metrics specific to certain groups of people or locations. For example, one's can view the data to see sales metrics for customers in a particular city or sales metrics depending on gender.

Two charts are shown on the Web app: sales by hour or sales by product. These graphs can help users identify trends and patterns in the data.

Overall, this demo of Excel-based app creation allows users to quickly and easily create an app that displays important metrics and charts from their Excel data. The ability to filter it by various criteria makes it easy to gain insights and make informed decisions.
